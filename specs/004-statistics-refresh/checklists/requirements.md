# Specification Quality Checklist: Auto-Refresh Statistics Grid

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All checklist items complete

**Details**:
- Specification is clear and technology-agnostic
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-006) are testable
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Edge cases identified for error handling, time boundaries, and performance
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- Out of scope section prevents scope creep
- No implementation details present (no mention of JavaScript, HTML, or specific API endpoints)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (no clarifications needed)

## Notes

None - specification is complete and ready for planning phase.
